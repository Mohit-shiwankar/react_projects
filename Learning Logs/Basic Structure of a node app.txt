/*
node_modules/: This is where Node.js modules are installed when you use npm to install dependencies for your project.

public/: This directory is used to store static files that can be accessed directly by the client (e.g., images, stylesheets, client-side JavaScript).

src/: This is the main source code directory for your application.

routes/: Contains Express route handlers. Each route file may handle specific paths in your application.

views/: If you're using a templating engine like EJS or Pug, this directory may contain your template files.

app.js: The main entry point for your Node.js application. This file typically initializes and configures your Express application, sets up middleware, and defines routes.

.gitignore: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by version control (Git, in this case).

package.json: This file includes metadata about your project, such as project name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It's also used to manage npm packages.

README.md: Project documentation that typically includes information on how to set up, configure, and run the application.
